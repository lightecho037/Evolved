### **Spectrum Network Monitoring Tool: Checkpoint and Troubleshooting Document**

#### **1. Purpose**
Define the purpose of the checklist:
- Ensure the Spectrum tool is functioning as expected.
- Provide a systematic approach to identify issues, engage SMEs, and escalate cases to the vendor.
- Minimize downtime and enhance operational efficiency in the Enterprise Command Center.

---

#### **2. Key Components of the Document**

1. **Preliminary Checks (Daily/Periodic Health Checks)**
    - Confirm the following components are operational:
      - **Spectrum Server Health:**
        - Server is powered on and reachable.
        - CPU, memory, and disk usage are within thresholds.
      - **Database Health:**
        - Database is online and responsive.
        - No abnormal growth or corruption in the database logs.
      - **Service Status:**
        - All Spectrum services (OneClick, SpectroSERVER, etc.) are running.
        - No unexpected restarts or crashes in the last 24 hours.
      - **Network Connectivity:**
        - Ensure connectivity between Spectrum components and monitored devices.
        - No significant packet loss or latency.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring Checks**
    - Verify Spectrum is detecting and processing alarms from monitored devices:
      - Alarm/Event Dashboard is populating data correctly.
      - Critical events are being escalated as per thresholds.
      - Devices are correctly categorized in models.
    - Check polling intervals:
      - Devices are being polled at expected intervals.
      - Responses are within acceptable latency limits.
    - SNMP and ICMP settings:
      - Ensure devices can communicate with Spectrum using these protocols.

3. **Incident Response Checklist**
    - Steps to take when a fault is detected:
      - **Verify Logs:**
        - Access Spectrum logs (e.g., `$SPECROOT/SS/Logs`) for errors or anomalies.
        - Identify if errors are related to services, database, or network connectivity.
      - **Engage SME:**
        - Contact the Subject Matter Expert for initial troubleshooting.
        - Document findings in the incident ticket.
      - **Pre-Vendor Escalation Checks:**
        - Attempt restarts of affected services (e.g., SpectroSERVER).
        - Clear stale sessions in `$SPECROOT/bin/clearCache`.
        - Validate configurations in the Admin Console.

4. **Vendor Engagement Protocol**
    - When to escalate:
      - Critical alarms not being generated or processed.
      - Persistent service crashes or database issues.
      - Network device communication failing despite configurations.
    - What to include in the case:
      - Summary of the issue.
      - Logs from Spectrum components.
      - Steps already taken for troubleshooting.
      - Impact analysis (number of devices affected, criticality to operations).

5. **Periodic Maintenance Checklist**
    - Weekly/Monthly tasks:
      - Backup configurations and databases.
      - Clean up old logs to free up disk space.
      - Apply patches and updates (coordinate with vendor if needed).
      - Validate discovery of new devices in the network.
      - Perform failover testing (if applicable).
