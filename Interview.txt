Good morning [Candidate Name]! thank you so much for making time to meet with us today. My name is Ilian, I am the Application Manager for the Network Tools team here at Citi.

I am going to talk about the expectations for the interview, this interview will run about 60 to 90 minutes, and we’ll focus on two key areas:

First, 
	We’d like to hear about your professional experience.  
	how you approach different work situations, 
	what you’ve learned along the way. 
	and how you manage challenges.
	
Then, 
	we’ll shift into the technical side of the position.
	to see how your skills align with the tools and technologies we currently support supporting.

Before we dive in, let me give you a quick snapshot of the role:

First of all. 
	It’s an application support position with a mix of development and operational tasks.
	You’d be working mostly with Linux systems, 
		and there will be times when you need collaborate with engineers to write Python scripts
		or develop Grafana dashboards for the purpose of monitoring Network infrastructure.
	
	Since we provide support to critical systems/applications, 
		This role includes on-call responsibilities as part of a team rotation. 
		Typically, this means being on call for one weekend every few weeks, 
		and occasionally handling after-hours support if critical issues arise.
		the position is hybrid so you can work from home and office.

We’re looking for someone who’s technically strong, adaptable in a fast-paced environment, and enjoys solving problems while helping teammates learn.

Does that sound like the kind of role you were expecting? Any questions before we get started?"
