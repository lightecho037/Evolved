Throughout this year, I have consistently met expectations while managing a portfolio of over 20 network automation and monitoring tools, including HP Network Automation, Broadcom DX NetOps, Cisco DNA, Arista CloudVision, and more. I lead a team of nine SMEs, balancing both technical hands-on work and strategic coordination to ensure operational stability and continuous improvement.
A key highlight of the year was our team’s success in completing several major projects:
RHEL 8 migration across multiple systems.
Corvil replacement and Broadcom DX NetOps OS/application upgrades.
Cisco Prime decommissioning and onboarding of new tools such as Arista CloudVision and Cisco DNA to operations.
We also effectively managed three major incidents (MIMs) by partnering closely with vendors and engineering teams to restore functionality quickly and prevent business impact.
Operationally, we strengthened our model by establishing dedicated 24/7 support, including L2 and L3 tiers, which significantly improved responsiveness and knowledge transfer. We also closed critical SD-WAN monitoring gaps by enhancing Nagios alerts and developing IPSLA dashboards to provide better visibility and analytics. Collaboration remained a core focus, as we worked regularly with engineering, ECC, and compliance teams to deliver solutions aligned with enterprise standards.
On the development side, I continued expanding my own technical and leadership skills, focusing on areas such as AI, Python, Grafana, and network automation technologies. Looking ahead, I plan to concentrate on supporting the new tool currently under development and exploring emerging network technologies to strengthen operational intelligence and automation capabilities.
Overall, I believe my performance this year demonstrates reliability, teamwork, technical leadership, and a strong commitment to continuous improvement across our operations.

risk

Throughout the year, I have maintained a strong focus on risk management and operational controls across all supported tools. I ensured adherence to enterprise standards, implemented proper change and patch management procedures, and collaborated closely with compliance and security teams to minimize operational risk.
I proactively identified potential issues before they caused impact, documented all process changes, and reinforced control practices with my team of SMEs. Our transition to a structured 24/7 operations model and improved incident management processes strengthened control consistency and reduced risk exposure.
Additionally, I promoted a culture of accountability by reviewing audit requirements, validating configurations, and ensuring system access and operational activities complied with internal policies. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to maintaining a strong control environment and supporting organizational compliance objectives.

financial

Throughout the year, I contributed to strong financial performance by ensuring efficient use of resources and reducing operational costs across multiple network automation platforms. By completing key projects such as the RHEL 8 migration, Corvil replacements, and Cisco Prime decommissioning, we successfully retired legacy systems and avoided extended support costs.
I also helped optimize vendor engagement by coordinating timely upgrades and reducing unplanned maintenance expenses through proactive monitoring and issue resolution. The introduction of a 24/7 support model improved service continuity and reduced escalations, translating into measurable cost avoidance.
Overall, I maintained strict budget awareness, maximized existing tool capabilities instead of unnecessary expansions, and supported initiatives that aligned with cost efficiency and operational excellence.

Franchise

This year, I consistently supported our internal clients by ensuring the stability and reliability of over 20 network automation and observability tools critical to business operations. Through proactive maintenance, timely upgrades, and rapid response to incidents, we minimized disruption and enabled our partners to meet their service commitments to end users.
I worked closely with engineering, ECC, and compliance teams to align deliverables with client needs, enhance monitoring visibility, and accelerate resolution of high-priority issues. By introducing new dashboards, improving SD-WAN event monitoring, and onboarding new tools such as Cisco DNA and Arista CloudVision, we improved transparency and responsiveness across the network ecosystem.
My team’s ability to deliver consistent results and maintain strong collaboration helped reinforce client confidence, strengthen franchise reputation, and support operational excellence across the enterprise.

sch

During this performance year, Sricharan completed several assigned tasks and contributed to the operational responsibilities of the team. However, overall engagement and responsiveness have been below expectations. Attendance in scheduled meetings and collaborative discussions has been inconsistent, which has limited opportunities for effective coordination with peers and impacted the team’s overall productivity.
While approximately 70% of deliverables were completed satisfactorily, timelines were often extended, and proactive communication around delays or dependencies was limited. Additionally, support for teammates and willingness to assist with overflow work needs improvement to maintain balanced workloads across the group.
Going forward, I encourage Sricharan to increase participation in team activities, maintain consistent communication, and take a more proactive approach to completing tasks and supporting others. With improved engagement, ownership, and time management, he can significantly enhance his overall performance and contribution to team success.

LDR Ship Srch 
Sricharan has demonstrated an understanding of his role and has expressed interest in developing his technical skills through training and automation initiatives. He also contributed to certain operational activities, including EOVS and VTM remediations, and participated in some L1 support efforts.
However, overall performance this year did not meet expectations. Engagement and participation levels were inconsistent, with limited attendance in team meetings and minimal collaboration with peers. Task completion often required follow-ups and exceeded expected timelines, impacting overall team efficiency. Several goals outlined earlier in the year, such as completing automation projects and maintaining consistent documentation, were not fully achieved.
Moving forward, Sricharan is encouraged to focus on improving ownership, accountability, and communication. Increased collaboration with the team, timely completion of deliverables, and active participation in discussions will be essential for meeting expectations in the next review cycle.

Risk and control Srch
Sricharan demonstrated an understanding of key risk and control activities and participated in several initiatives such as Python automation for vulnerability reporting, Nagios cleanup, and Shark model maintenance. These contributions supported operational stability and ongoing remediation efforts across multiple tools.
However, overall execution in risk and control management did not consistently meet expectations. Many assigned tasks required repeated follow-ups and lacked timely completion, which affected progress toward remediation and compliance targets. Proactive communication and ownership were limited, and escalation of issues was not always timely.
While Sricharan has acknowledged these areas for development and has outlined a plan for improving communication and accountability, sustained consistency and reliability will be essential to demonstrate effective control management in the next review cycle. Focus on initiative, responsiveness, and timely delivery will be critical for improvement.
