During this performance year, Sricharan completed several assigned tasks and contributed to the operational responsibilities of the team. However, overall engagement and responsiveness have been below expectations. Attendance in scheduled meetings and collaborative discussions has been inconsistent, which has limited opportunities for effective coordination with peers and impacted the team’s overall productivity.
While approximately 70% of deliverables were completed satisfactorily, timelines were often extended, and proactive communication around delays or dependencies was limited. Additionally, support for teammates and willingness to assist with overflow work needs improvement to maintain balanced workloads across the group.
Going forward, I encourage Sricharan to increase participation in team activities, maintain consistent communication, and take a more proactive approach to completing tasks and supporting others. With improved engagement, ownership, and time management, he can significantly enhance his overall performance and contribution to team success.

LDR Ship Srch 
Sricharan has demonstrated an understanding of his role and has expressed interest in developing his technical skills through training and automation initiatives. He also contributed to certain operational activities, including EOVS and VTM remediations, and participated in some L1 support efforts.
However, overall performance this year did not meet expectations. Engagement and participation levels were inconsistent, with limited attendance in team meetings and minimal collaboration with peers. Task completion often required follow-ups and exceeded expected timelines, impacting overall team efficiency. Several goals outlined earlier in the year, such as completing automation projects and maintaining consistent documentation, were not fully achieved.
Moving forward, Sricharan is encouraged to focus on improving ownership, accountability, and communication. Increased collaboration with the team, timely completion of deliverables, and active participation in discussions will be essential for meeting expectations in the next review cycle.

Risk and control Srch
Sricharan demonstrated an understanding of key risk and control activities and participated in several initiatives such as Python automation for vulnerability reporting, Nagios cleanup, and Shark model maintenance. These contributions supported operational stability and ongoing remediation efforts across multiple tools.
However, overall execution in risk and control management did not consistently meet expectations. Many assigned tasks required repeated follow-ups and lacked timely completion, which affected progress toward remediation and compliance targets. Proactive communication and ownership were limited, and escalation of issues was not always timely.
While Sricharan has acknowledged these areas for development and has outlined a plan for improving communication and accountability, sustained consistency and reliability will be essential to demonstrate effective control management in the next review cycle. Focus on initiative, responsiveness, and timely delivery will be critical for improvement.
